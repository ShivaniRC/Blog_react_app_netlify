    "title": "Homecoming by Kate Morton",
    "datetime": "July 16, 2023 11:47:39 AM",
    "body": "A struggling journalist named Jess travels from London to Sydney after receiving a call that her grandmother has suffered a fall and is seriously ill in the hospital. Upon returning to the house where she was raised, she stumbles upon a true crime book chronicling a long-buried murder case: the Turner family tragedy of 1959. As she flips through its pages, an eerie feeling creeps up her spine and she discovers an appalling connection between her own family and this unsolved murder case. “Homecoming” is a story that spans generations, asking important questions such as how far we go to protect the ones we love, which secrets are better kept hidden and what it means to come home."

    "title": "Camp Zero by Michelle Min Sterling",
    "datetime": "July 16, 2023 11:47:48 AM",
    "body": "In remote northern Canada, in a near-future world, a team is breaking ground on Camp Zero – a project intended to create shelter and a new life for those displaced by climate change. Rose joins a group hired to entertain the men in the camp – but her real mission is to secretly monitor the architect at the helm of the project. In return, she’ll receive a home for herself and her Korean immigrant mother. But upon arriving, she quickly discovers she’s not the only one with a hidden agenda. Told through a mix of perspectives – such as a professor yearning to escape his wealthy family and an all-women military research unit at a climate station – “Camp Zero” is an exploration of the community that can be forged in the midst of disaster."

    "title": "Confessions of a Shopaholic, by Sophie Kinsella",
    "datetime": "July 16, 2023 11:48:01 AM",
    "body": "“Shopping is actually very similar to farming a field,” reflects Becky Bloomwood, the stylish protagonist of Kinsella’s 2000 hit novel. “You can't keep buying the same thing, you have to have a bit of variety. Otherwise, you get bored and stop enjoying yourself.” Barbie, who by some estimates has a total of one billion outfits (including a farmer getup) knows of what Becky speaks. While there are some crucial differences between the two—for example, Becky is a British human with some serious credit card debt, and Barbie is a plastic American with beachfront property in Malibu—the two are united by their passion for fashion, and by how far they are willing to go for a perfect stiletto."

    "title": "What Is History? by Edward Hallett Carr",
    "datetime": "August 09, 2023 4:44:22 PM",
    "body": "Famous for his hefty History of Soviet Russia, E. H. Carr’s foray into historiography (that is, the study of written history) was panned by critics at first. Initially written off as ‘dangerous relativism’, it is now considered a foundational text for historians, one which probes at the very seams of the discipline. By asking what exactly historical knowledge is and what constitutes history as we have come to understand it, Carr provides a compelling and masterful critique of the biases of historians and their moralized narratives of history. This groundbreaking text also interrogates such notions as fact, science, morality, individualism, and society. Carr’s masterpiece is referenced in countless college applications for a reason — it’s a formidable dive into history as a discipline, and laid the foundations for the subject as it exists in the modern world."
